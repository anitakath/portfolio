        description: " I am a successfully trained registered nurse with a passion for technology and sports. As a creative mind, I like to test different applications and program my own solutions to develop innovative applications that help me to better structure my everyday (sporting) life. In addition to my enthusiasm for sports and programming, I am interested in traveling and am actively learning Spanish. I enjoy reading non-fiction books - I'm currently immersed in Women Living Deliciously by Florence Given - and to switch off mentally and physically, I like to visit thermal baths, spas and massages or bake cakes and tarts. I'm also passionate about watching live sporting events and supporting various teams, such as the Adendorf Ice Hockey Club.",
